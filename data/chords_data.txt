Given a major scale (ex C D E F G A B C) the chords can be any one of these: Cmaj7 Dm7 Em7 Fmaj7 G7 A-7 B-7b5

In a minor scale (ex C D Eb F G Ab Bb C) the chords can be any one of these: Cm7 Dm7b5 Ebmaj7 F-7 G-7 (or G7b9) Abmaj7 Bb7 (or Bdim7)

## Secondary dominants

The possible secondary dominants (secondary dominants always occur before the chord they are the secondary dominant of) in a major scale are:
D7 (or D9 or D13) is the secondary dominant of G
C7 (or C9 or C13) is the secondary dominant of F
E7 (or E(b9) or E(b13)) is the secondary dominant of Am
A7 (or A9 or A(b13)) is the secondary dominant of Dm
B7 (or B(b9) or B(b13)) is the secondary dominant of Em

to get the secondary dominant of any chord just go up the scale by 4 notes more and make it a 7 chord (ex. G -> A -> B -> C -> D7 )

The possible secondary dominants (secondary dominants always occur before the chord they are the secondary dominant of) in a minor scale are:
C7 (or C9 or C(b13)) is the secondary dominant of F 
D7 (or C(b9) or C(b13)) is the secondary dominant of G 
Eb7 (or Eb9 or Eb13) is the secondary dominant of Ab
Bb7 (or Bb9 or Bb(b13)) is the secondary dominant of Eb

A7 is often resolved in D7 and then in G7 like so: A7 D7 G7

## Tritone substitution

In a major mode
Whenever you find G7 you can substitute it by Db7 (this is a tritone substitution) and resolve it to Cmaj7: Db7 C
Whenever you find D7 you can substitute it by Eb7 (this is a tritone substitution) and resolve it to Dm7: Eb7 Dm7
Whenever you find B7 you can substitute it by F7 (this is a tritone substitution) and resolve it to Em7: F7 Em7
Whenever you find C7 you can substitute it by Gb7 (this is a tritone substitution) and resolve it to Fmaj7
Whenever you find D7 you can substitute it by Ab7 (this is a tritone substitution) and resolve it to G7
Whenever you find E7 you can substitute it by Bb7 (this is a tritone substitution) and resolve it to Am7
