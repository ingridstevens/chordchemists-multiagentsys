B section rules:

Generally, the B section (often called the “bridge”) is designed to create contrast and lead the listener away from the home tonal center established in the A sections, eventually guiding back to it. Here are some common approaches and “rules of thumb”:
Change of Tonal Center:
Modulation or Tonicization: The B section often temporarily moves the harmony away from the A section’s key center. For example, if the A sections are in C major, the B section might pivot towards the key of the IV (F major), the relative minor (A minor), or a more distant key.
Use of Dominant or Secondary Dominants: Frequently, the B section will highlight V-of-V (secondary dominants) or other distant tonal relationships that are less emphasized in the A sections.
Contrast in Harmonic Rhythm and Color:
Faster Harmonic Motion: If the A section has relatively static or diatonic harmony, the B section might introduce more frequent chord changes or a sequence of II-V progressions to create momentum.
Greater Chromaticism: While the A sections may be more diatonically “grounded,” the bridge might incorporate chromatic passing chords, tritone substitutions, or altered dominants to provide a fresh harmonic palette.
Cycle of Fifths / Circle Progressions:
Many B sections use chains of II-V progressions cycling through different keys before resolving back to the tonic in time for the final A section. For instance, if the tune is in C major, the bridge might move through II-Vs in different keys (e.g., II-V in D minor, then II-V in E minor, etc.) before ultimately returning to a II-V leading back into C major.
Heightened Tension Leading to Return:
The B section often introduces more tension—through dissonance, key changes, and altered dominants—so that when the tune returns to the A section, the original key and themes feel comfortably resolved.
Sometimes the B section strategically withholds full resolution, only hinting at it through cadential gestures that set up the return to A.
Melodic and Harmonic Independence:
The B section is frequently more independent melodically and harmonically, functioning as a “bridge” not just in name, but in effect: it connects the repeated A sections by providing a departure.
This can mean simpler “blueprint” chords that allow melodic improvisation or complexity that wasn’t present in the A sections.
Borrowing From Related Modalities or Parallel Keys:
Some bridges might shift to the parallel minor or borrow chords from modal mixtures to create color contrasts. For example, if A is in a major key, the B section might incorporate borrowed chords from the parallel minor to darken the sound before returning.
In summary: The B section typically contrasts harmonically with the A section by employing new key centers, more chromaticism, different harmonic rhythms, and a series of transitional chords (often II-V patterns) that eventually lead the listener back home. This contrast is a central aesthetic feature of AABA form and is what makes the B section feel like a true “bridge.”
